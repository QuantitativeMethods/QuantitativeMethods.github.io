Research often involves data. We use it not only to weight the evidence for a hypothesis, but also to find ways to make sense of our subject; to make new discoveries; and to fuel future inquiries. With the increasing availability of data, quantitative methods are becoming ever more useful.

It is offered as part of the training within the PhD program of the <a href='https://www.upf.edu/en/web/universitat/-/departament-de-traduccio-i-ciencies-del-llenguatge' target='_blank'>Translation and Language Sciences Department</a>.
