## Description

Research often involves data. We use it not only to weight the evidence for a hypothesis, but also to find ways to make sense of our subject; to make new discoveries; and to fuel future inquiries. With the increasing availability of data, quantitative methods are becoming ever more useful. 

However, working with data can be daunting, particularly when starting out. The goal of this training series is to provide a forum for discussion and guidance for your quantitative needs. It is offered as part of the training within the PhD program of the [Translation and Language Sciences Department](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/universitat/-/departament-de-traduccio-i-ciencies-del-llenguatge) and is entirely optional.
